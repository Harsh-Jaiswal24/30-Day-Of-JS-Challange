Day 1 : Variables & DataTypes
Learnings:

1. Array is decleared by [ , , , ] and We can't change the index of array
2. Object is decleared by { , , , , } and We can change the index
3. Array can be accessed by A[0], A[1] only
4. Object can be accessed by O.1, O.2 only
5. We can add Array in Object and Object is Array


Day 2 : Operators
Learnings: 
1. ==   True (type coercion)       First convert into same datatype than compare
2. ===  False (different types)    Do not change datatype direct compare

Day 3 : Control Structures
Learnings:

1. IN JAVASCRIPT SWITCH CASE CANT DIRECTLY USE FOR COMPARISION OR DIFERENT CONDITIONS USE SWITCH(TRUE) AND THAN DIRECTLY PUT THE COMAPRISION IN "CASE COMAPRE:" TO RUN
The switch (true) syntax allows us to evaluate each case based on a boolean expression (true in this case), which checks each condition (score >= 90, score >= 80, etc.) sequentially until one matches.

Day 4 : Loops
Learnings: 

1. Learnt about Printing shapes using Nested loops

DAY 5 : FUNCTIONS 
Learnings: 

1. TON CHECK A CHARACTER EXISTS IN A STRING OR NOT USE "strname.includes("character")
2.  WHILE CALLING A BIG FUNCTION OR MAIN FUNCTION WE HAVE TO GIVE FUNCTION NAME IN CALLING SYNTAX OTHERWISE ERROR WILL GENERATED 
    sumofcars(f1,f2,15)  here f1 & f2 are different functionname of function created. 
3. USE f2(f1(a)) type for calling one by one function with in same. 

Day 6 : Array
Learnings: 

1. FOR PRINTING LAST OF ELEMENT IN ARRAY USE "arraylength" -1
2. PUSH METHOD INSERT THE ELEMENT AT LAST
3. Unshift use for add a number at first position in Array
4. Shift use for remore a element from array from first place
5. Map is for Create a new array from a existed array by changing in value of previous array
6. Filter is use for creating a new array from an existing array  which consists only some satisfied elements.
7. the reduce method in JavaScript is used to "reduce" an array to a single value. It executes a provided function for each element of the array and accumulates a result
8. forEach is used for access all the elements of the array and we can manupulate is also is requied

Day 7 : Objects 
Learnings: 

1. Entries method in JS create a copy of all elements of object into elements of array and return in the form of array.
2. Assign is used to copy all the object into new and if update the existed objcet will be updated and original will also be updated
3. In JavaScript, the 'this' keyword is a special identifier that refers to the current execution context. Its value is determined by how a function is called, and it allows functions to dynamically access and interact with objects at runtime.
4. In JavaScript, the for...in loop is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object. It allows you to loop through the keys (property names) of an object, including inherited properties from its prototype chain.
5. The Object.keys() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property keys.
6. The Object.values() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values.

   (Task ::  learn more about different types of Methods and keywords).

Day 8 : ES6+ Features 
Learnings: 

1. The spread operator is used to expand elements of an iterable (like an array) into places where multiple elements (or arguments) are expected. Here Spread operator used to concatenate arrays.
2. Destructuring in JavaScript allows you to easily extract values from arrays or Objects and assign them to variables in a concise way. 
3. The rest parameter syntax (...) allows functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array. It collects all remaining arguments into an array.
4. Computed property names in JavaScript allow you to dynamically define object properties using variables or expressions inside square brackets ([]) within an object literal.
