Day 1 : Variables & DataTypes
Learnings:

1. Array is decleared by [ , , , ] and We can't change the index of array
2. Object is decleared by { , , , , } and We can change the index
3. Array can be accessed by A[0], A[1] only
4. Object can be accessed by O.1, O.2 only
5. We can add Array in Object and Object is Array


Day 2 : Operators
Learnings: 
1. ==   True (type coercion)       First convert into same datatype than compare
2. ===  False (different types)    Do not change datatype direct compare

Day 3 : Control Structures
Learnings:

1. IN JAVASCRIPT SWITCH CASE CANT DIRECTLY USE FOR COMPARISION OR DIFERENT CONDITIONS USE SWITCH(TRUE) AND THAN DIRECTLY PUT THE COMAPRISION IN "CASE COMAPRE:" TO RUN
The switch (true) syntax allows us to evaluate each case based on a boolean expression (true in this case), which checks each condition (score >= 90, score >= 80, etc.) sequentially until one matches.

Day 4 : Loops
Learnings: 

1. BREAK: BREAK OUT THE CURRENT AND NEXT ALL ITTERATIOIN (jumpout2 loops)
2. TO AVOID PRINTING IN NEW LINE USE process.stdout.write("");
3. CONTINUE: WILL EGNORE THE CURRENT ITTERATION AND MOVE TO NEXT
